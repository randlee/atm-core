- binary SHA: `85249bbc38dd58e5d6735560611ff7ad5f443be1`
- duration secs: `11.655`
- summary: `pass=8`, `fail=0`, `skip=0`

  that row were executed after the failure

| Row | Flow | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AD11-CMD-SEND-001` | send command preserves caller-context ownership across environment and explicit override paths | `PASS` | send stays bound to the shared caller-context contract across environment and explicit override paths |
| `AD11-CMD-READ-001` | read command preserves caller-context ownership across environment and explicit override paths | `PASS` | read stays bound to the shared caller-context contract across environment and explicit override paths |
| `AD11-CMD-MEMBERS-001` | members command remains daemon-independent while preserving explicit team override handling | `PASS` | members remains daemon-independent while preserving retained caller-team semantics |
| `AD11-CMD-TEAMS-001` | teams list command remains daemon-independent on the retained CLI surface | `PASS` | teams list remains daemon-independent on the retained CLI surface |
| `AD11-CMD-LOG-001` | log command remains daemon-independent with caller-context enforcement at the CLI boundary | `PASS` | log remains daemon-independent and still fails locally when caller context is unavailable |
| `AD11-CMD-DOCTOR-001` | doctor remains identity-free while preserving optional team scoping and the direct local path | `PASS` | doctor remains identity-free while preserving optional team scoping and the direct local path |
| `AD11-POSTSEND-LOCAL-TMUX-001` | local tmux post-send requires and uses authoritative pane metadata | `PASS` | local tmux post-send remains bound to authoritative roster pane metadata |
| `AD11-POSTSEND-WARNING-001` | sender-visible warning fallback survives failed post-send emission | `PASS` | failed post-send emission still degrades into a sender-visible warning after durable send success |
